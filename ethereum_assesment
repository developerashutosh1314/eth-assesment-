       REQUIREMENTS
    1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
    2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
    3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. 
       The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance 
       of the “sender” address by that amount
    4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. 
       It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply 
       and from the balance of the “sender”.
    5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal 
       to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

contract MyToken {

    // public variables here
    string public TokenName = "MetaCrafters";
    string public TokenAbbrv = "MTCR";
    uint public TotalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping (address => uint) public Balances; // passing an address to it, will return the token amount of that address is having.

    // mint function
    function mint(address _address, uint _value) public{
        TotalSupply += _value;    //It increases the TotalSupply by the specified _value.
        Balances[_address] += _value;
    }
//It first checks if the balance of the specified _address is greater than the _value to be burned.
    // burn function
    function burn(address _address, uint _value) public{
        if (Balances[_address] > _value){
            TotalSupply -= _value;
            Balances[_address] -= _value; 
        }
 
    }
